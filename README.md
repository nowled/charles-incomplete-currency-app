# Requirements

* Build a simple currency converter that will allow users to convert from USD to their local currency and vice versa

* You are provided with an incomplete <CurrencyConverter /> component.
* You are not allowed to add any additional HTML elements (you already have all the elements needed).
* You are not allowed to use refs.

* Demo video - You can view how the completed functionality should look at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P23Fi6oH_piLeCwi5mMNLLHNI_LACZwF/view?usp=sharing

* Once the <CurrencyConverter /> component is mounted, load the currency list and exchange rates using the getCurrencies and getExchangeRates functions imported.
* Update the currency list in state, this will render the currencies in the select elements provided
* Update the exchange rates in state to complete the implementation of the getRate function
* Implement the following functionality:
  * As the user types the amount, the conversion should be done instantly using the rate returned from the getRate function
  * The conversion must be possible in both directions - if you select USD and EUR, typing a USD amount should calculate the EUR amount, and typing a EUR amount should calculate the USD amount. 
  * Changing the currency should trigger a recalculation based on the amount entered for the currency that was changed. 
  * Display the rate used for the conversion in the provided div
  * All converted amounts should be displayed to 2 decimal places using the round function provided

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
